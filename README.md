## Purdue Calorie Calculator

App for Purdue Students to easily track and store caloric and nutritional info from Purdue dining courts.

Category: health & fitness

Evaluation:
Mobile: This mobile app is way more convenient than using a website.

Story: For people trying to monitor caloric/nutritional intake, this app would be very convenient and helpful. 

Market: Population of Purdue students living on campus.

Habit: This app can easily create a habit because if the user uses the app every time they eat at a dining court, they will use it at least 2 times a day on average.

Scope: The app does not use techniques that are extremely challenging, and even a stripped-down version of the app would still involve various fundamentals and aspects of iOS programming.
